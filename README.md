Use Google Maps timeline to filter your location coordinates and visualise in pretty sheets

This tool takes your Google Maps timeline data and filters on the regex of location coordinates to give the dates of when you were present there.

## Setup

    * Run the script

    ```
    ./when-was-i-here.sh <path-to-location.json> <regex-for-location>
    ```
